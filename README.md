# ProjectArpan

ProjectArpan is an Android application built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern.

Users can easily find maids or contractors nearby and directly connect with them for hiring.

## Features

- **User Profiles**: Allows maids and contractors to create profiles showcasing their skills, experience, and availability.
- **Location-Based Search**: Users can search for maids or contractors based on their location.
- **Direct Communication**: Facilitates direct communication between users and service providers to discuss terms, availability, and other specifics.
